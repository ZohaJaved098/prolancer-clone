# Prolancer Clone (Next.js & Tailwind CSS)

This project is a clone of **Prolancer**, a freelance marketplace website, developed using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** during my internship at **Qwerty Experts**. The objective was to replicate the design and layout of the Prolancer website, providing hands-on experience with building modern, responsive web applications using these technologies.

### Project Overview
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive, with the layout adjusting for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Tech Stack**: Built using **Next.js** for server-side rendering, routing, and React functionality, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling and layout.

### Features
- **Home Page**: A replica of the Prolancer homepage, featuring sections like services, features, and call-to-action buttons all **non-functional**.
- **UI/UX**: Replicated the clean and modern layout of the original Prolancer site to demonstrate proficiency in responsive design and user interface development.

### Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: For routing, server-side rendering, and dynamic page creation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: To quickly build a responsive and customizable layout using utility-first CSS classes.
- **React**: For managing the website's components and handling state.

**Note**: This project is a clone of the Prolancer website for educational purposes, and **not functional**. It is purely for practice and to learn how to implement web layouts using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
